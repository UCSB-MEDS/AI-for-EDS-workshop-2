## Contributors
These workshop materials were developed by [Carmen Galaz García](https://github.com/carmengg) (Bren Teaching Faculty), [Kat Le](https://github.com/katleyq) (Technical Applications Manager), and [Sam Shanny-Csik](https://github.com/samanthacsik) (Data Science Programs Manager & Lecturer). We draw on materials and approaches from a variety of sources, leaning heavily on discussions with other Bren Faculty and education efforts by folks at [NCEAS](https://www.nceas.ucsb.edu/) and the [UCSB Office of Teaching and Learning](https://otl.ucsb.edu/cop/artificial-intelligence-community-practice).
